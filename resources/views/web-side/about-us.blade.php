			typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's
			standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an
			unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to
			make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five
			centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting,
			remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the
			1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem
			Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop
